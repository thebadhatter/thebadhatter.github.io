# Midnight Teaparty

Figured it was a hip name for a hipster hacker site administrated by a guy who
goes by the moniker badhatter... any complaints? feel free to put em in the [complaint box](http:://thebadhatter.github.com/complaintbox.html).

## Point of this site:

I originally started this site just messing around with jekyll and the ability to host static pages on github pages. I then decided it was probably a good place to keep important information, writing pieces, tutorials, walkthroughs and general information I am constantly needing again and again and keep looking it up again and again instead I can have it all together in one place all nicely organized.
