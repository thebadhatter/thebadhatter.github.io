Alot of people seem to just play it by ear just going about life without any real plan or forethought into
what it is exactly they are doing. To react as somthing happens. To constantly make
split second decisions. What about having every possibly outcome that could occur in response to
any situation scenerio or action that could occur all in the depth of your brain just waiting
to be utlized to form the best chain of events possible towards a goal you intend to reach. Planning is so key.
But then comes the plans and the variables for the poassible outcomes of plans and planning ahead on what can go right what
can go wrong. You will never beable to map out every little likelihood but the probable ones should be reflected on.


# Game Theory
+ To live by a strategy to view obstacles and things that may make a goal more difficult as
a strategic oppononent capable of this awareness of gamethreory; able to throw a wrench in your box,

## To dance with the word.
+ To master the manuevablability of your words throughout conversation is a key skill. To move
conversation towards one topic and away from another to cold read subtle changes in someones behavior
following an event occuring and test responses by remembering past conversations possibly with the other conversant
to gain key information by paying attention to not only what they say. But what they leave out. Sometimes what people
leave out will yield way more valuable information,

## Be subtle with it, man. You know what subtle means?
+ To be invisible is to do everything unoticed. Who is to stand in your way if no one even sees you
heading closer to your goal.
